# Motion Planning
Computational Motion Planning course from Penn. Matlab implementation of the tasks can be found in matlab_src folder.
Each of the subfolder includes run.m script for simulation launching and subfunctions.
In order to launch the algorithms simply execute:

run.m

in your Matlab command line.

Python code that is aimed to apply path planning algorithms for real mobile robots is located in pthon_src folder.
In order to launch the algorithms:

python3 gradient_online.py
python3 GradientBasedPlanner.py
jupyter-notebook GradientBasedPlanning.ipynb

- Real time potential fields-based obstacle avoidance method with moving or static obstacles.
